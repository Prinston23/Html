JavaScript is also used in environments that are not Web-based, such as PDF documents,
 site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets. Newer and faster JavaScript virtual machines (VMs)
 and platforms built upon them have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side Web applications. 
On the client side, developers have traditionally implemented JavaScript as an interpreted language,
 but more recent browsers perform just-in-time compilation. Programmers also use JavaScript in video-game development,
 in crafting desktop and mobile applications, and in server-side network programming with run-time environments such as Node.js.
